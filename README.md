# An aspiring Cybersecurity Pentester and Reverse Engineer.

Hello! I'm Raffi Molero.

I'm a developer by day, but I prefer diving into the inner workings of software at night, picking apart every abstraction until all "magic" becomes a flowchart.

My projects range from silly to downright deep and unconventional. Whatever it is, **"It just needs to be possible."**
